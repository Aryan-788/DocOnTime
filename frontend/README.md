4. `rafce` is a shorthand snippet in **React** commonly used with **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** in **VS Code**. It stands for **React Arrow Function Component with Export**. When you type `rafce` and press enter, it generates a boilerplate for a functional component with an export.

### Example of `rafce` Usage:

Typing `rafce` and pressing enter in a file with the ES7+ extension installed will generate the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const ComponentName = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your JSX here */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

### How to Set Up the `rafce` Shortcut:
1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to **Extensions** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets** by **dsznajder** and install it.

After installation, you can use `rafce` to quickly create a functional component with export in your React projects.
